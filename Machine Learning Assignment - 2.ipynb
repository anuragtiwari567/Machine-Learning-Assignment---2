    "## Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "* Overfitting in machine learning occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and as a result, it becomes too complex and highly specialized to the \n",
    "         training data. The model will perform poorly on new, unseen data as it has memorized the training data instead of learning the general patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "* underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the training data, resulting in poor performance \n",
    "         on both training and new data.\n",
    "         \n",
    "    - The consequences of overfitting are reduced generalization ability, poor performance on new data, and high variance. The consequences of underfitting are poor performance on both training and new data, and high bias.\n",
    "    - To mitigate overfitting, one can use techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and early stopping. Cross-validation helps to assess the model's  generalization ability by using multiple splits of the data for training and testing. Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the objective function of the model to prevent over-reliance on any one feature. Early stopping involves stopping the training process before the model becomes too complex.\n",
    "    - To mitigate underfitting, one can use techniques such as increasing the complexity of the model, adding more features, or increasing the amount of training data. However, it is important to ensure that the model does not overfit the data in the process."
